# E-Commerce App

E-Commerce App made from scratch using PERN Stack
https://ecommerce-eb562.web.app/

## Description

This E-commerce App represents an online store where a customer can register/login, edit its profile, browse products per categories or search, add items to cart, checkout, pay and see previous orders.

The goal of this project was to create an e-commerce website using everything I learned so far in a single project: a FullStack app using PERN stack (Postgres for DB, Express & NodeJS for Back-End and React for Front-End).

## Technology used

- Javascript
- React
- Recoil
- Express JS
- Node JS
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap
- JTW

## Challenges and improvements

Some challenges faced during the project learning and implementing JWT authentication, checkout management with stripe and deployement.

More features that I would like to implement in the future include:

- Admin authentication and dashboard : Special authorization, add and edit products, see all users and orders.
- Add email management for users (order confirmation, checkout uncompleted)

## How to use

Simply create an account using any real or fake email (no verification implemented yet) and a password.
Once logged-in you can access your account, edit your personnal and address information and add items to the cart.
You can process the payment (via Stripe) using the test card :

- card number 4242 4242 4242 4242
- validity : any future date
- CVC : any
- name: any
