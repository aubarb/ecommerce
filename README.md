# E-Commerce App

E-Commerce App made from scratch using PERN Stack
https://ecommerce-eb562.web.app/

## Description

This E-commerce App represents an online store where a customer can register/login, edit its profile, browse products per categories or search, add items to cart, checkout, pay and see previous orders.

The goal of this project was to use everything I learned so far in a single project: a FullStack app using PERN stack (Postgres for DB, Express & NodeJS for Back-End and React for Front-End).

In addition to the PERN Stack I also used JWT for authentication, Bootstrap for styling and Recoil for state management.

Some challenges faced during the project learning and implementing JWT authentication, checkout management with stripe and deployement.

More features that I would like to implement in the future include:

- Admin authentication and dashboard : Special authorization, add and edit products, see all users and orders.
- Add email management for users (order confirmation, checkout uncompleted)
